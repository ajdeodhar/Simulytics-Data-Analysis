# Simulytics Data Analysis

This project involves analysis of real-world supply and dispatch data using a combination of Excel, PostgreSQL, and Python. The goal was to extract actionable insights on vendor efficiency, cost optimization, and shipment behavior across zones and sizes.

## Key Highlights

- Cleaned and merged multi-source datasets (Excel files, zone mapping, cost tables)
- Wrote optimized SQL queries to extract metrics such as:
  - Current vendor-wise supply volume
  - Cost incurred by vendor and shipment zone
  - Cost-saving opportunities based on alternate vendor routes
- Used Python for:
  - Cost computation and comparison logic
  - Savings visualization
  - Exporting results to Excel

## Tools Used
- PostgreSQL
- Python (Pandas)
- Excel
